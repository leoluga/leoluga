## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I am a nearly graduated Aerospace Engineering student at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA) with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in programming and engineering. I am passionate about space technology, quantitative finance, and full-stack development. My journey is driven by curiosity and a desire to apply my skills to real-world challenges. Currently, I am interning at Legacy Capital, where I work on a volatility table, applying my skills in Python, C, MATLAB, React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I approach graduation, I am excited to begin my master's degree in physics, focusing on machine learning.
